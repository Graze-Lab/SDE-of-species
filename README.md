# SDE-of-species
## Authors: Mursalin Khan & Krista Fincke

**Summary**: Using publicly available RNA-seq data from 8 *Drosophila* species, we aim to characterize how sex-differential expression changes amongst lineages. Specifically, we are interested in changes amongst lineages in regards to immunity and hormone-signaling genes. We will use differential expression analysis to accomplish these aims.
