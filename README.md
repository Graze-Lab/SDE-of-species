# SDE-of-species
## Authors: Mursalin Khan & Krista Fincke

**Summary**: Using [publicly available RNA-seq data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE99574) from 8 *Drosophila* species, we aim to characterize how sex-differential expression(SDE) changes amongst lineages. Specifically, we are interested in changes amongst lineages in regards to immunity and hormone-signaling genes. We will use differential expression analysis to accomplish these aims. After running the data through established pipelines, we will write a script to display differential expression and other statistics based on comparisons chosen by the user.

### Introduction: ###
  In the Graze lab, we are broadly interested in how sex-differential expression within *Drosophila* contributes to evolution of gene regulation. Master's student Krista Fincke is interested in how SDE may be a resolution to sexual conflict in hormone-signalling gene regulation pathways. PhD student Mursalin Khan is interested in [YOU CAN FINISH THIS SENTENCE BC I'M SURE YOU CAN DESCRIBE YOUR WORK BETTER THAN I CAN].
  Yang et al. performed RNA-seq on 8 *Drosophila* species: *D. melanogaster, D. yakuba,  D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. willistoni, D. verilis, D. persimilis, and D. mojavensis* to later be re-annotated in their paper "Re-annotation of eight *Drosophila* genomes." By having expression data from a range of species from the *Drosophila* phylogeny, "within lineage" evolutionary comparisons can be made to help answer some of the questions our lab poses.
